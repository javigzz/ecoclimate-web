<h1>R scripts</h1>

<p>R-scripts to deal with netCDF files, perform downscaling and compute 19 bioclimatic variables are available at <a
    href="https://github.com/ecoClimate" target="_blank">github.com/ecoClimate</a>.
</p>
<p>Explore them and advance your limits on new variables!</p>

<p>Here you have an R-script for opening ecoClimate.org layers in R. Our climatic layers are stored as *.txt* files. Thus,
    you need to open them using the function read.table and then construct raster files (maps) as follows:</p>

<p>1. <strong>download the climatic layers</strong> (.txt files) from ecoClimate.org</p>
<p>2. <strong>save them</strong> in a folder in your computer and use the function ‘setwd’ to set this folder as the working
    directory</p>
<p>3. open the file in R using ‘read.table’</p>
<pre class="rcode">setwd("Path/Of/Folder/With/Climatic/Layers")

CCSM_LGM &lt;- read.table("FileName.txt",&nbsp;header&nbsp;= TRUE)

head(CCSM_LGM)</pre>

<p>4. <strong>load the libraries</strong> to work with GIS formats in R, (install them first if you do not
    have them in your computer; use the function ‘install.packages’)</p>
<pre class="rcode">library(sp)

library(raster)</pre>

<p>5. Run this simple code in order to construct raster files for each climatic layer</p>
<pre class="rcode">gridded(CCSM_LGM)&nbsp;&lt;- ~long+lat

map_CCSM_LGM &lt;- stack(CCSM_LGM)</pre>

<p>6. Finally, you can plot the raster files using your own palette of colours</p>
<pre class="rcode">colores_t &lt;- colorRampPalette (c("darkblue", "blue",

            "lightblue",&nbsp;"white", "salmon", "red"))</pre>

<p>in this example, we are plotting the temperature variables (thus, we select the maps 2 to 12))</p>

<pre class="rcode">plot (map_CCSM_LGM [[c(2:12)]], axes=F, box=F, col=colores_t (100))</pre>

<p>here, we use $ in order to select one specific variable (e.g., bio.1)</p>
<pre class="rcode">par (mar=c(1,1,1,1))

plot (map_CCSM_LGM$bio.1, axes=F, box=F, col=colores_t(100), legend=T)

title ("LGM Bio1 CCSM")</pre>

<p>now, we are going to change the colours because we want to plot the precipitation layers (13 to 20)</p>
<pre class="rcode">colores_p &lt;- colorRampPalette (c("white","lightblue","blue", "darkblue"))

plot (map_CCSM_LGM [[c(13:20)]], axes=F, box=F, col=colores_p (100))</pre>

<p>we hope that this R-script will help you to understand how to easily work in R with raster files<br>
